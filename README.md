# Prometheus Workshop

## ToC


## Intro

This workshop will cover

- Fundamental concepts of metrics scraping using Prometheus
- Extending a demo application with Prometheus scraping using built-in and
  custom metrics
- Adding Grafana dashboard to represent Prometheus metrics
- Defining rules for triggering of alerts
- Quick talk about exporters

In this session, the students will be presented with a modern approach
to collecting metrics, which will be used for creating threshold and alerts
for operational monitoring. This session is meant to be hands-on, where students
interact with the tools and code.

The students will go through the full flow of instrumenting code to having
alarms being triggered in a combination of Prometheus and Grafana. 

The outcome should be a good understanding of how metrics scraped through
Prometheus supports operations.
